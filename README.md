# js-tip-calculator

This exercise has been adapted from [Carolyn Hemmings](https://codepen.io/cphemm/) Codepen of the same name: https://codepen.io/cphemm/pen/reNwWd

I claim no right to this code and have copied it for teaching purposes only.

`CSS` and `HTML` have been provided. `Javascript` needs to be added to give functionality to the tipping calculator.
